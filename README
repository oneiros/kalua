= Kalua =

Kalua is a free (as in freedom), light-weight, web based
calendar.

It is currently being developed using Ruby on Rails
(http://www.rubyonrails.org) on the server side and
Adam Shaw's FullCalendar (http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/)
on the client side.

Everything that works is due to Adam and everything that
does not work is totally my fault.

Kalua is licensed under an MIT license (because, frankly,
AGPLv3 is just too complicated).
