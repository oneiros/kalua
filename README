= Kalua =

Kalua is a free (as in freedom), light-weight, web based
calendar.

It is currently being developed using Ruby on Rails
(http://www.rubyonrails.org) on the server side and
Adam Shaw's FullCalendar (http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/)
on the client side.

Everything that works is due to Adam and everything that
does not work is totally my fault.

I am serious. Kalua is in very early stages. But I believe
in "Release Early, Release Often", so here it is.

At this point it does not do much, but if you want to give
it a try, there is a reference installation at 
http://kalendr.net.

Also, feel free to fork and submit patches or simply
report some bugs and feature requests.

Kalua is licensed under an MIT license (because, frankly,
AGPLv3 is just too complicated to use properly).
